# HostingBot
You can do whatever, but if you want to use large sections of code I'd ask for you to request permission first.   
The program is run from HostingBot.py. Most modules can largely run on their own, unless they call other modules. To run them, add the appropriate respond function to the on_command bot function (see HostingBot.py). Some modules may require other stuff.  
The contents of orgs.json and messages.json were left empty for privacy reasons.
